Messages
========

Messages is a new SMS app. There are many SMS apps around, so what makes Messages different? Well, not a lot. But it is open-source. With the advent of Google Hangouts, work on the Android default Messaging app is bound to cease, so the aim of this project is to keep an open-source messaging app available.
